# Case Study

The assignment is split into two sections. The first section will be an exploratory analysis of the dataset we have provided. The second
section will be a more fundamental prediction problem. These sections are not necessarily mutually exclusive, and we hope that you
can use some of the insight gained in section 1 to inform your decisions in section 2.

Section 1

The data

You will only need to use the data we have provided. The dataset is the public results of Stack Overflow’s developer survey:

• survey results public.csv - The survey results from the Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Each row is one respondent’s answers.

• survey results schema.csv - A schema providing a brief description of each column of the above dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis

Please provide an exploratory analysis of this dataset. We would usually treat this section as a narrative, providing an explanation for
each piece of analysis we produce. We expect part of this exploration to be a basis for the next section. For section 1, you are free to
use whichever approach/approaches you feel most comfortable with or find most suitable. We do ask, however, that what you
provide is reproducible on our end.

Section 2

Predictive Model

Finally, we would like you to create a (Python code based, reproducible) model that can predict the number of years'
experience a respondent has had programming.

We would like to see a model that works best on this prediction task, with a clear representation of the model selection and
performance testing that you have applied.

Please provide a clear explanation of your choices and results in the walk through.
